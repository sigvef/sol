| HONEYCOMB BY NINJADEV |
#=======================#

Hi everyone,  this is our
first demo!  The demo  is
Chrome-only due to use of
the  wekbit webaudio API,
sorry firefox users!

Please  run  Chrome  with
the  --allow-file-access-
from-files  flag  if  you
want   to  run  the  demo
directly  from  the  file
system.    If   you  have
python installed, you can
run    our   conveniently
bundled   server.py  from
the demo   directory  and
direct  your  browser  to
localhost:80.

Music, graphics and code:
        stiaje
